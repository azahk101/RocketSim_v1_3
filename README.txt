RocketSim v1.4
This program is a rocket simulation project, attempting to provide data points for the trajectory of a model rocket, with characteristics specified by the user.
In this library are several classes meant to model different rocket components (fins, engine, etc.) and the acting forces (drag, thrust, gravity).
Additionally, there are several classes meant to provide visual aid to the program (graph, nose cone representation).
This code utilizes the GUI capabilities provided by Andreas Schlegel's ControlP5 library.
